Description of the theme we have chosen and ideas about how we will incorporate it into our design:
The theme Modern Nature is amassed with the beauty of life bursting like a spectrum of color or whiffs of fragrances that envelopes the imagery of a Zen Garden. We incorporate the colorful flowers and leaves in the theme represent the natural essence of vitality. The variegated colors depicted in the shades of purple and green are the royal introspections that abound in life. The green color is for Nature, new beginnings, and abundance. Purple is for the creative minds, royalty, and wealth of knowledge in store for our exploration. The immensity of space and time on earth is like an ocean of Zen Garden, full of passion and dedication amidst struggles and challenges. In correlation, we would like to incorporate the Modern Nature concept into our design to indulge the world harmonize the magnificence of Nature and technology into One.
